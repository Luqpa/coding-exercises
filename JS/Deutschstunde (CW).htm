Everybody knows a little german, right? But remembering the correct articles is a tough job. Write yourself a little helper, that returns the noun with the matching article:

    each noun containing less than 2 vowels has the article "das"
    each noun containing 2/3 vowels has the article "die"
    each noun containing more than 3 vowels has the article "der"

Caution: Vowels are "a,e,i,o,u". Umlaute (ä ö ü) are also being counted!

(This Kata is a joke, there is no such grammar rule!)

<script>

function derDieDas(wort){
 
 var regex = /[aeiouäöü]/gi;
 var regres = wort.match(regex).length;
 

  if (regres < 2) {
    return 'das '+wort;
  } else if (regres < 4) {
    return 'die '+wort;
  } else if (regres > 3) {
    return 'der '+wort;
  }

}
 
  
 var ret1 = derDieDas('se');
  console.log (ret1);
 

  </script>
